# The Art of Minimalism

Minimalism isn’t about having less — it’s about making room for what matters.

> “Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.”

## Principles

- Clarity over clutter  
- Function over form  
- Whitespace as a design element  

### Code Example

```css
body {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
}
```
